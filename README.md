ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Felipe and I am a student of Systems Analysis and Development.
I graduated in Visual Arts and am an artist focused on illustration and graphic design.
Although I really like this area, I decided to venture into programming and become a future developer.
This space is aimed at my studies and small projects.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in movies, graphic novels, cats, grunge music e programming

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#/Python
